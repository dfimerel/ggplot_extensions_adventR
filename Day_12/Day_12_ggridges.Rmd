# Creating ridgeline plots

## Overview
The ggridges package provides a way to create ridgeline plot.
For the full documentation visit: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html

## Code
```{r}
# Load libraries
library(ggridges)
library(dplyr)

# Create some sample data
# Christmas tree names
tree_names <- c("Fir","Spruce","Pine","Cedar","Cypress","Redwood","Hemlock","Juniper","Maple","Oak","Birch","Cherry","Palm","Sycamore","Willow","Magnolia","Aspen","Poplar","Chestnut","Pecan")

# Christmas tree sizes in feet
tree_sizes <- c(6, 7, 5, 8, 6.5, 9, 7.5, 5.5, 8.5, 6.8, 7.2, 5.7, 4.5, 6.2, 8.3, 5.8, 7.8, 6.3, 7.1, 8.8)

# Christmas tree prices in dollars
tree_prices <- c(40, 60, 30, 80, 45, 120, 90, 55, 100, 70, 75, 50, 35, 65, 110, 40, 95, 60, 85, 130)

# Creating groups based on price
tree_groups <- ifelse(tree_prices <= 70, "Affordable", "Luxury")

# Creating a data frame
christmas_trees <- data.frame(Tree_Name = tree_names, 
                              Tree_Size_Feet = tree_sizes,
                              Tree_Price_Dollars = tree_prices, 
                              Tree_Group = tree_groups)


# Create a dataset
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  category = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 100),
  value = c(rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 2),
            rnorm(100, mean = 15, sd = 2),
            rnorm(100, mean = 12, sd = 2)))

# Make a ridgeline plot using ggridges
ggplot(christmas_trees,aes(x = Tree_Price_Dollars, y = Tree_Group, fill = Tree_Group)) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(y="",x="Tree price (Dollars)",fill="Tree Group")
