# Creating beeswawrm (scatter) plots

## Overview
The ggbeeswarm package allows the user to create beeswarm plots, so that overlapping points fall next to each other.
For the full documentation visit: https://github.com/eclarke/ggbeeswarm

## Code
```{r}
# Load library
library(ggbeeswarm)

# Create some sample data
# Christmas tree names
tree_names <- c("Fir","Spruce","Pine","Cedar","Cypress","Redwood","Hemlock","Juniper","Maple","Oak","Birch","Cherry","Palm","Sycamore","Willow","Magnolia","Aspen","Poplar","Chestnut","Pecan")

# Christmas tree sizes in feet
tree_sizes <- c(6, 7, 5, 8, 6.5, 9, 7.5, 5.5, 8.5, 6.8, 7.2, 5.7, 4.5, 6.2, 8.3, 5.8, 7.8, 6.3, 7.1, 8.8)

# Christmas tree prices in dollars
tree_prices <- c(40, 60, 30, 80, 45, 120, 90, 55, 100, 70, 75, 50, 35, 65, 110, 40, 95, 60, 85, 130)

# Creating groups based on price
tree_groups <- ifelse(tree_prices <= 70, "Affordable", "Luxury")

# Creating a data frame
christmas_trees <- data.frame(Tree_Name = tree_names, 
                              Tree_Size_Feet = tree_sizes,
                              Tree_Price_Dollars = tree_prices, 
                              Tree_Group = tree_groups)

# Make a beeswarm plot using ggbeeswarm
ggplot(christmas_trees, aes(x = Tree_Group, y = Tree_Price_Dollars, col=Tree_Group)) +
  geom_beeswarm() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(title = "Beeswarm Plot", x = "Tree group", y = "Tree price (Dollars)")
