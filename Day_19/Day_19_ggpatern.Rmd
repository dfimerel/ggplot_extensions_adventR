# Create areas in plots filled with patterns

## Overview
The ggpattern package provides custom ggplot2 geoms which support filled areas with geometric and image-based patterns.
For the full documentation visit: https://coolbutuseless.github.io/package/ggpattern/

## Code
```{r}
# Load library
library(ggpattern)
library(ggplot2)

# Create some sample data
# Christmas tree names
tree_names <- c("Fir","Spruce","Pine","Cedar","Cypress","Redwood","Hemlock","Juniper","Maple","Oak","Birch","Cherry","Palm","Sycamore","Willow","Magnolia","Aspen","Poplar","Chestnut","Pecan")

# Christmas tree sizes in feet
tree_sizes <- c(6, 7, 5, 8, 6.5, 9, 7.5, 5.5, 8.5, 6.8, 7.2, 5.7, 4.5, 6.2, 8.3, 5.8, 7.8, 6.3, 7.1, 8.8)

# Christmas tree prices in dollars
tree_prices <- c(40, 60, 30, 60, 45, 120, 100, 55, 100, 70, 75, 50, 35, 65, 100, 40, 95, 60, 95, 100)

# Creating groups based on price
tree_groups <- ifelse(tree_prices <= 70, "Affordable", "Luxury")

# Creating a data frame
christmas_trees <- data.frame(Tree_Name = tree_names, 
                              Tree_Size_Feet = tree_sizes,
                              Tree_Price_Dollars = tree_prices, 
                              Tree_Group = tree_groups)

# Create the plot
ggplot(christmas_trees) +
  geom_col_pattern(
    aes(Tree_Group, Tree_Price_Dollars, pattern_fill = Tree_Group), 
    pattern = 'stripe',
    fill    = 'white',
    colour  = 'black') +
  theme_bw(18) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') + 
  labs(x="Tree Group",y="Tree Price (Dollars)")
