## Overview
The patchwork package provides an easy way to combine separate ggplots in the same graphic. 
For the full documentation visit: https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/

## Code
```{r}
# Load the packages "ggplot2" and "patchwork"
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(ggpubr)

# Create some sample data
# Christmas tree names

# Creating groups based on price

# Combine two plots
p1 + p2

# Combine three plots (2 in the first line and 1 in the second)
(p1 | p2) / p3
