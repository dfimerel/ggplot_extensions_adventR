## Code
```{r}
# Load library
library(kableExtra)

# Create some sample data
# Christmas tree names
tree_names <- c("Fir","Spruce","Pine","Cedar","Cypress","Redwood","Hemlock","Juniper","Maple","Oak","Birch","Cherry","Palm","Sycamore","Willow","Magnolia","Aspen","Poplar","Chestnut","Pecan")

# Christmas tree sizes in feet
tree_sizes <- c(6, 7, 5, 8, 6.5, 9, 7.5, 5.5, 8.5, 6.8, 7.2, 5.7, 4.5, 6.2, 8.3, 5.8, 7.8, 6.3, 7.1, 8.8)

# Christmas tree prices in dollars
tree_prices <- c(40, 60, 30, 80, 45, 120, 90, 55, 100, 70, 75, 50, 35, 65, 110, 40, 95, 60, 85, 130)

# Creating groups based on price
tree_groups <- ifelse(tree_prices <= 70, "Affordable", "Luxury")

# Creating a data frame
christmas_trees <- data.frame(Tree_Name = tree_names, 
                              Tree_Size_Feet = tree_sizes,
                              Tree_Price_Dollars = tree_prices, 
                              Tree_Group = tree_groups)

# make it shorter for illustration purposes
christmas_trees_short = head(christmas_trees,5)

# Create a classic table and define the text fonts
christmas_trees_short %>%
  kbl(caption = "Christmas trees classic table") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")

# Create the table where you can hover over the values
christmas_trees_short %>%
  kbl(caption = "Christmas trees table with hover") %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)

# Create the dark themed table
christmas_trees_short %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_material_dark()
